Project Boomerang: Generative Evolutionary Swarm Agents.

This will be the repository for development on Generative Evolutionary Swarm Agents designed and optimized for inter-systems processeses and communications through serialized message passing also known as state transfer. It is generative form of evolutionary because it allows an 'agent' aka "Node" to revert or change state based upon factors such as history and new/recent developments impacting current running state.

Boomerang is an appropriate term used as it describes the process of collective decentralized message passing eventually coming back to the given host agent.

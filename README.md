Shattered Glass: Generative Evolutionary Swarm Agents.

ShatteredGlass provides the capability to discreetly add vectors of multivariate differential equations into a single message representing each pane of glass (dimension), inside of the message contains a randomly distributed set of rules, unique identifiers, actions, and commands incorporating the features of discrete mathematics and predicate order calculus based upon a provided set of parameters followed by a matrix transpose function, "refractor". 

Illustration:

Imagine you have a pane of glass in your hands and then deliberately shatter it on the ground. The pane of glass now becomes many tiny pieces of glass that even though you may know for certain you have ALL of the pieces, it is impossible to place the pieces back together without using highly advanced techniques, which is undoubtedly an impossible activity once I pick up the pieces and throw them in all directions. this is in effect what we are discussing when it comes to the non-linear asynchronous process of message passing from host to host until it reaches its intend destination.  


Unlike a Jigsaw puzzle where there are obvious differences and can easily be placed together a Shattered Pane of Glass cannot. Instead the server can logically recouple the missing parts using localized embedded knowledge and inference machines using differential equations in order to make sense of the message and state.


Application:

SECURELY COMMUNICATE VIA EMAIL OR ANY APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL TO AN INTERMEDIARY ACTING AS A VPN TO THE PUBLIC INTERNET USING APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOLS EMBEDDED INTO A FIREFOX WEB BROWSER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE THAT COMMUNICATIONS MUST CHANNEL ACCROSS THE APPLICATION LAYER; HOWEVER, THE MESSAGE ITSELF MAY LEVERAGE AND CONTROL ALL 7 LAYERS OF THE OSI MODEL.

Key Considerations and Concepts:

Each Agent works as a "REFRACTOR" Agent, waiting on messages to pass through that when "Refracted" allow (metaphorical) "light" to pass through 2 or more pieces based on differential functions. In other words, because a small but significant number of pieces are withheld some of the knowledge must be inferred. Without knowledge or a clue as to what is the basis of said inference then it is unequivocally impossible to accurately decipher that message with or without encryption.


*Using something called a "Refractor" to metaphorically shine light through the pieces of glass to see where it shines. Meaning to Transpose the message and find the "meaning".

*Some of the pieces of a chosen subset are intentionally withheld at random, making it impossible to decipher an incomplete message if adversary has not identified predicate association. 

For instance, if I stated "walk Charlie" you would have to understand that Charlie is a dog and not a human but even in the most basic example such as this Charlie COULD very well be a human; thus, if the message was to "walk Charlie" but on a Tuesday (just an example) then that may invert the message to suggest that "Charlie" is human. The message itself does not contain all the meaning or context, as that is held on the server itself and can in-part be determined on a message-by-message basis on the "Refractor" Agents.


It is entirely up to the owner of the Agents to decide how much context should only be stored on the central server(s) and how much is spread out on the ShatteredGlass pieces.


This will be the repository for development on Generative Evolutionary Swarm Agents designed and optimized for inter-systems processes and communications through serialized or non-serialized message passing, also known as state transfer. It is generative form of evolutionary because it allows an 'agent' aka "Node" to revert or change state (REFACTOR) based upon factors such as history and new/recent developments impacting current running state.


ShatteredGlass is an appropriate term used as it describes the process of collective decentralized message passing eventually coming back to the given host agent.


EMAIL EXAMPLE:


INITIAL EMAIL 



SET RULE(S)
    WRITE A RANDOM MESSAGE SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING:
    
  From: "jane@doe.com"
  To: "joe@doe.com"
  Subject: "Hey there!"
  
  "Please remember to take Charlie on a walk, but not Mittens because she is a cat and taking a cat on a walk is strange. Overall, my day went well but the boss said I should follow the rules more carefully, so I did!. Other than that I went to the store and bought some cosmetics, food, etc... it only took me 4 hours waiting in line! Also, before I forget Please send Jessica an email reminding her to come to the party this Saturday."
   
 
 ORDER CAN BE RELATIONAL, SYNTACTICAL, OR ARBITRARY.
      
 
 FIRST, YOU NEED TO KNOW THERE ARE NUIANCES IN THE MESSAGE THAT TOLD THE RECEIVING SERVER SEVERAL KEY FACTS. 
 
 HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: LET "R" = SET OF RULES.
      
 e.g. R = [ rule,rules,<2-char variable punctuation>,(uncommon regular pattern such as 'etc...'), timeinterval ] 
 
 R = [ 'remember', 'Charlie walk', 'not Mittens', 'rules', '.', 'etc...', 'jessica@domain.com', 4 ]
 
 
IN THIS EXAMPLE THE FOLLOWING OCCURED:


 1. WE MENTIONED THAT WE NEED TO "remember" TO TAKE "charlie" ON A "walk" => CHARLIE IS A DOG. "remember" MEANS TO STORE TO DISK A SPECIFIC RULE AND THE VERB "walk" was assigned to Charlie with no other parameters in this case. IF THE SERVER CONTAINED A HARDCODED GRAPH ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DOG ==> WALK AS CODE FOR MAKING A GET REQUEST TO AN HTTPS WEBSITE. THE MESSENGER MAY BE ASKING FOR THE DATA OF A STANDARD GET REQUEST OVER 443 HTTPS.
 
 
 2. WE SAID "not" TO TAKE "Mittens" ON A WALK (INFERRED). THIS REQUIRES AN INFERENCE MACHINE TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER, IF CHARLIE IS A DOG THAT NEEDS A WALK BUT NOT THE CAT MITTENS, THEN THE STANDARD FORM AS A DIFFERENTIAL FUNCTION WOULD ASSOCIATE A COMMAND WITH AN ACT BUT WITH LIMITING OR NEGATING FACTORS IN ORDER TO CREATE A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE DATA OR POSSIBLE COMMANDS. EFFECTIVELY, THIS COULD BE SOMETHING AKIN TO AN UPDATED query such that "charlie" = "SELECT * WHERE <DOG_CHARLIE> GROUPBY <CAT_MITTENS>;"
 
 
 THE BOOLEAN LOGIC HERE IS IN EFFECT TELLING THE SERVER TO RUN COMMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC DISAGGREGATED NUISANCES.
 
 
 3. FURTHERMORE, WE TOLD THE SERVER THAT WE INTEND TO WRITE A TEMPRORARY RULE AND THAT THE RULE WAS PREDICATED BY A "." AND THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER MESSAGE FOLLOWING THIS ONE BECAUSE WE PROVIDED THE "etc...". 
 
 
 4. SINCE WE ADDED A TIME INTERVAL WE EXPANDED THE DEFAULT WAIT PERIOD TO 4 HOURS OR ELSE FORGET THIS RULE.
      
 5. FINALLY, WE SAID TO "send" A MESSAGE TO "Jessica", NOW THIS IMPLIES THAT "Jessica" MUST BE A NAME ASSOCIATED TO A DOMAIN (Implied from use of "send") ASSIGNED FROM AN EARLIER MESSAGE OR THAT IT WILL BE PROVIDED LATER AS IS THE CASE IN THIS MESSAGE WITH THE "etc..." WHERE I DECIDED TO SEPERATE THE PRIMARY MESSAGE INTO 2 SUBCOMPONENTS TO THROW OFF ANY ALGORITHMS TRYING TO DETECT PATTERNS IN THE CONTENT OF SINGLE EMAIL BODY, AS NO AMOUNT OF SOPHISTICATION WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT "Jessica" IS CODE FOR BECAUSE I HAVE NOT EVEN WRITTEN IT DOWN AT THIS POINT!      
 
   ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        *CONVERT TO PLAINTEXT FROM 2048-BIT RSA ENCRYPTION TO AVOID SUSPECION AND DETECTION.
